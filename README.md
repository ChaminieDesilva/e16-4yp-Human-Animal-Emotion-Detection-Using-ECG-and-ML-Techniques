# Human/Animal Emotion Detection Using ECG and ML Techniques

Human emotion recognition using ECG and machine learning techniques has been successfully demonstrated in the literature. The emotions of sentient beings are traditionally distinguished by three components: valence, arousal, and dominance. Different emotions can be identified by analysing filtered and processed ECG signals and using machine learning techniques.  

This project follows the previous work, [“An Ensemble Learning Approach for Electrocardiogram Sensor-Based Human Emotion Recognition”](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/20/4495), where valence and arousal have been used for emotion detection. Currently, it can recognise four primary emotions, anger, sadness, joy, and pleasure, in the discrete emotion model with up to 80% accuracy. This value is a significantly better result compared to the literature. This accuracy is achieved by combining selected feature extraction methods with an ensemble learning process.

In this project, we expect to extend this current work by using all three components, valence, arousal, and dominance, for emotion detection, thereby increasing the number of emotions detected by the model with higher accuracy. The current dataset should be expanded by increasing the number of users, and these users should be of different varieties so that the dataset is much improved. Furthermore, we are also expecting to explore the possibility of applying the same process to detect basic emotions in animals.
